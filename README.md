# Mini-Python-Project

This project allows for an individual to find the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in New York State at any given dates. The user inputs five different dates and the code then generates the five death counts that were recorded on each date. The number of deaths are not the numbers of deaths that occured on that day. Instead, the code generates the cumulative number of deaths up until that day in time.

Graphs were developed in order to show the rise in deaths caused by COVID-19. Depending on the dates chosen, the user can see either a rapid or steady increase/decrease in cases that correlates to the handling of the pandemic at the time. For instance, in the winter months, COVID-19 was taking lives at a faster rate compared to the summer months, due to the cold weather. 

The purpose of the notebook and code are to take in the data values from the NYS COVID-19 history csv file and create an input-output system based on how many deaths were caused by COVID-19 cumulatively after each day. The user inputs five dates, in time order, (year-month-day format) and in return, five death counts are outputted according to each date respectively. The code asks for five dates in order to display a trend on how fast or slow the death toll is rising in New York State over a few days, weeks, or months.
