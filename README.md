# Mini-Python-Project

This project allows for an individual to find the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in New York State at any given dates. The user inputs five different dates and the code then generates the five death counts that were recorded on each date. The number of deaths are not the numbers of deaths that occured on that day. Instead, the code generates the cumulative number of deaths up until that day in time.

Graphs were developed in order to show the rise in deaths caused by COVID-19. Depending on the dates chosen, the user can see either a rapid or steady increase/decrease in cases that correlates to the handling of the pandemic at the time. For instance, in the winter months, COVID-19 was taking lives at a faster rate compared to the summer months, due to the cold weather. 

The csv file of the deaths in New York State by day was imported into the code. An output file of the death count was drawn from the original NYS history csv file. Columns were formed and labeled by "date", "state", and "deaths".
