# Mini-Python-Project

This project allows for an individual to find the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in New York State at any given dates. The user inputs five different dates and the code then generates the five death counts that were recorded on each date. The number of deaths are not the numbers of deaths that occured on that day. Instead, the code generates the cumulative number of deaths up till that day in time.
